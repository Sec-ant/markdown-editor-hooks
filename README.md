# markdown-editor-hooks

A primitive set of react hooks to help implement a wysiwyg react markdown editor with [`@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror`](https://github.com/handlewithcarecollective/react-prosemirror), [`prosemirror-remark`](https://github.com/marekdedic/prosemirror-remark) and [`prosemirror-unified`](https://github.com/marekdedic/prosemirror-unified).

This package is a work in progress and is absolutely not yet ready for use.
